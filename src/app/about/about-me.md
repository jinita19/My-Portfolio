# About Me

## My Journey into Code

As a kid fascinated by computers, I pursued Computer Engineering where software languages has deepened my interest for coding. I landed my first job in my final year and was appointed to a live project within 15 days. That's where I discovered my greatest joy – seeing how my code directly impacts real users, shaping my focus on user-centric and scalable solutions.

## Beyond the Screen

When I'm not coding, I explore my creative side through craft activities. My core values:

- Hard work with honesty pays off in the long run
- Accountability and clear communication are the foundation of how I work and live.
- Daily motivation to contribute meaningfully and learn something new

## My Approach

Every project starts with clarity:

- Clear requirements and clarifying questions
- Understanding product vision and business outcomes
- Creating flow diagrams for complex features
- Breaking challenges into manageable chunks
- Systematic execution for on-time, quality delivery

## What Excites Me

I'm drawn to projects with genuine impact, especially in:

• Fintech • Healthcare • Aviation • Education

Projects that solve real-world problems excite me most – whether simplifying processes, improving accessibility, enhancing privacy, or making products more engaging. I want my code to make the world a little bit better.
